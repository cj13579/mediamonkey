			<p>Welcome to Media Monkey. I hope you find it an improvement on the previous interface to my movies and TV. At the moment only the Movies section is fully working with the new look and while there is a "library" view available for TV you can't download anything through it yet. Don't fear though, you can us the "tv" and "tv2" links as of old to get all available TV episodes.
			
			<p>I don't know whether or not any of you do but for quite a few of the TV episodes and a few of the movies you can stream them straight from your browser (Chrome works the best). The files need to be MP4. If you want to do that with any of the films then you will need to use the "films" menu which will take you to the familiar boring site. The library mode will force you to download the file.
			
			<p>Although I have tested downloading a few movies there is a chance that some stuff doesn't work. So, please let me know if anything is broken and I'll do my best to get it sorted for you ASAP.
			<p> Ta, Chris.
